  <p>Hello. My name is Francis. I&nbsp;am a writer, designer and environmentalist. Welcome to my blog. I hope you become friends with the voices in my head.</p>

  <p>Read an excessively abbreviated profile <a href="/about">about me</a> (that's more out of context than a helpful autobiography) and maybe the voices won't seem too much like radio static.</p>

  <p>I'm also on <a href="https://twitter.com/freeingfrancis" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/freeingfrancis" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
