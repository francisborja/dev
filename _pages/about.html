<h1>My name is Francis and Francis means freedom.</h1>

<p>This blog is meant to be a repository for all the voices in my head, all screaming to be heard, like futile attempts at social media fame. Things get a little weird here sometimes, but if you read my blog often or you know me in real life, you know that’s quite normal. Otherwise, this is just an ordinary blog with an overabundance of opinion—mostly so I can pretend I am as smart as I want to be.</p>

<div class="img-container"><img src="/assets/img/me1.jpg" /></div>

<p>I am a writer and designer by day, a film buff by night, a transitioning vegan during mealtime, and an environmentalist for every second of my life. I am a selectively social ambivert, oscillating between textbook introversion and sporadic spurts of a desperate need to swim into a crowd. Go figure.</p>

<p>I like taking <a href="https://instagram.com/freeingfrancis" target="_blank">pictures</a>, even when I’m nearly as much a failure at photography as I am in physics. I also <a href="https://twitter.com/freeingfrancis" target="_blank">tweet</a> sometimes, but mostly to incite climate action. I hate studying but I love learning, and I think an open mind is more indispensable than a diploma (but please stay in school if you’re already there).</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say go have fun reading, because introspection and the inexorable outward release of my soul isn’t necessarily enjoyable. But if I have made you understand or made you feel understood, and allowed you to feel the full spectrum of emotion—then by all means have a great time.</p>
