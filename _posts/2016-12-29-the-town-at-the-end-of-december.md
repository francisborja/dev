There is a town at the end of December<br />
Where the stars look down at the sea.<br />
It was a cold night when I realized<br />
That the stars were looking for me.<br />

So I put on my robe and I put on my suit<br />
And I rode to the nearest space station to fly.<br />
I went inside the rocket ship, looked back,<br />
Just one more time, to say goodbye.<br />

I flew, I flew, as fast as the rocket could,<br />
Faster than the speed of light.<br />
A million years later and a million years more,<br />
I came home to twinkle in the night.<br />
