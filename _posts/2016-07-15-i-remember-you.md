I remember you in the night, when the streets have silenced save from the countable cars that slip through empty roads. I remember you in the darkness, when all I have is my imagination of a story that could have been, written by my head that only thinks of you when I am alone. I remember you at midnight, when the clock has struck and the lights have gone to sleep and I am all by myself. You are a memory, fading like time and aging like the universe. For a moment you were my sun and I spun around your radiation. But it is dark and you are no longer here.
