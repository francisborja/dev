They took you, they took you back<br />
to the lonely forest, where<br />
it would be dark, very dark,<br />
and it will be cold, colder<br />
than music<br />
and birds will sing you sad songs<br />
and you will always be<br />

alone.

So I’ll wait here for you, for you<br />
to come back.

Listen to my voice<br />
even if I am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far away.<br />
I will wait for you, here<br />
where the sun shines<br />
and I will sing you a happy song, and<br />
you will sing with me, and<br />

we will walk together, together<br />
towards the sunrise<br />
where fear is an old, old memory<br />
and we’ve forgotten it<br />
and we’ve forgotten<br />
behind us/the rocky road<br />

and I will tell you,<br />
happily,<br />
truthfully,<br />
we will be fine.
