title: One Day With Government
date: 2014-12-12

When my boss pulled me out from my desk and from the chaotic mess on it, it never occurred to me that the day would also take its turn to pull me out from the mundane and push me into a C-130 military plane.

Here’s the thing: my boss is a big Australian man, thrown into mad, bloody Philippines. He dragged me to the Bureau of Customs, almost a week after Typhoon Ruby hit the Visayas, to help pull out a container van full of tarpaulins. These tarps will be delivered to Borongan, Samar, to provide temporary shelter for the families dislodged from their homes by the storm. Each hour we lost trying to complete a sheet full of unsigned blanks, is another night the families in Samar will spend sleeping out in the cold without a roof over their heads.

When we arrived at the BOC, we were welcomed by fat-bellied, burly men who sat all day, watching TV and telling people to go away and sending them to some other office at some corner at some building where, obviously, the receiving people had completely no idea what to do with our emergency. So my boss put on his pissed off but composed face and spoke as clearly and as less-accented as possible to explain the situation. He would introduce himself, our organization, what happened in Samar (heavily assuming these people are unaware of the effects of the storm), and what we need to get done before lunchtime.

The onlookers, who, for some reason, were surprised some man was speaking in loud English, would gawk at his beard and try to decipher his message. One man, the head of the office they say, tells my boss that our papers aren’t here, it’s somewhere there, it’s going to takes some time, and, no, I cannot help you find it (because unless you give me one hundred pesos, I am practically useless to you, as I am to other people who pay me with their taxes). It is Filipino custom to be hospitable to white foreigners (despite their nationality, we call all of them Americans), so they all point to some direction in an effort to be remembered by a man they would most probably never see again.

We were taken to a quiet building with large, holed glass windows, where we would have to thoroughly explain again the problem. They tell us our papers where somewhere in the office (short for I don’t know, I don’t care, and don’t bother me because I have a million things to not do). This pissed my boss further so he explains again, this time with more body language. Lo and behold, the papers appear.

So a man in a yellow polo, shades, and an overabundance of gold and silver necklaces and rings, tells us hello, your papers are here, glad to meet you. But my boss, completely disregarding courtesies and pissed off at the fact that nobody could understand his bloody English and all his efforts to make them all jive with his urgency, drops his large hands on the yellow-polo man, implying that no one should waste his time further, and tells the yellow-polo man to bring him to whatever office the yellow-polo man likes.

We were taken back to the first office we entered and they say hey, you’re back, give me your papers and I’ll sign them so you can get off my back and I can continue watching TV. Now this is the part I don’t pretty much remember anymore because after going to three offices, we were taken to at least ten other offices and windows and a dozen other people. We still haven’t pulled out our container by lunchtime.

It is a law in the Philippines (and probably in other countries, too, but that’s not my point) that all government offices don’t have lunch breaks. Staff are required to take shifts so one person is working while the other is eating, then they exchange afterwards. It is also a law everywhere (now this is one of my points), that people shouldn’t pay more than they are required to. Silly thing I had to say that because that’s essentially common sense and it’s probably not a law anyway because nobody even has to talk about it into being legislated. It’s too simple and too basic to be a law.

But this is the scenery I am to take in at the BOC: people go around to get paperwork done, idly walking to photocopying machines and stapling stacks and stacks of documents with one hundred peso bills. They shake hands with bills in their palms and smile at their disposition. I am not shocked, as I have been incessantly told about the evils of government. But I am amazed at the audacity to staple bills onto paperwork, overly glaring and seemingly disinterested at whoever sees the deed. There is no hiding it, no sense of insecurity, of fear of getting caught. It was a blatant, systematic conspiracy right in front of me.

I do not know when, where, or how corruption began, or who started it, and I won’t bother to find out because the answers hide beneath the depths of history. I won’t point fingers either, because I’m sure my two hands and two feet do not have enough fingers and toes to point at them all. No one man can be corrupt on his own. He needs two or three to corrupt with him, and the rest to stay silent. There are no good men in corruption, only quiet and terrified ones.

What I am interested in is how we can eradicate corruption, one that’s deeply rooted into the system. I am interested in how we can chop down a tree to stop the roots from growing deeper into the soil.

Or we could always shoot them all down. Whatever works.
