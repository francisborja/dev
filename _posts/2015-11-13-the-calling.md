I have always been drawn to look up to the sky at night and gaze at the flickering stars. I could stare at them for hours, even if I’ve never begun to know the names of the constellations. It’s the one curiosity that I’ve never allowed myself to satiate, because I’m afraid that once I know what they are called, I would stop wondering what it would be like to meet them in person.
