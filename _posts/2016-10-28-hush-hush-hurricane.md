I think people confuse the capability of being alone with wanting to be alone. While I must admit that I enjoy being alone and love the company of solitude, it has mostly to do with the fact that I am capable of that isolation.

I think people are afraid to be alone because it’s socially constructed as the sibling of loneliness. We are social creatures by design, so we have a strong affinity for engagement. We like to be normal, to be part of the crowd, to be accepted, and that has everything to do with how we structure society.

So when people, like me and so many others, prefer our seclusion, we are estranged because we do not conform to social engineering. But it’s not because we are rebellious and we like to prove a point. It’s simply who we are. It’s anatomy, not a conscious decision. We are the eyes of storms—peaceful while the world around us is chaotic energy.

But we are better now. We are becoming more open to the concept of difference and individuality, and more accepting of a wide gamut of personalities. While we are not there yet completely nor will it be cosmically possible for each and everyone to be objectively understanding all the time, I am at peace with being with no one but myself. And I think, whether people are like me or not, a person should always find calm in their own silence.
