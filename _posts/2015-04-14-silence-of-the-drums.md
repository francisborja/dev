I’ve been regularly mentally dozing off lately, finding no reason to think about anything whatsoever, mostly because there’s just too many things in my head. It’s true that writers scientifically have a higher probability of losing their minds, because there are days—like today—when there’s just too much. Just. Too. Much.

It amazes me that the human brain can handle the amount of neurological activity that we have, more so on days when the universe is in its natural state of douche. I’ve surely been through worse, but it isn’t during the worse when I can’t handle myself, because worse is definitely more easily surmountable than the everyday calamity of normalcy. It is during the humdrum of every day, the mundane, the ordinary, the routine, when things pile up slowly, slowly towards the ceiling, and when it reaches the top, it just erupts. Like Big Bang, the birth of a galaxy, the death of a star, and then the dust settles from the wreckage and then quiet.

You can hear your own thoughts in the silence. You can hear them screaming, louder, louder, each second muddies their clarity, each minute they become more and more obscure.

Today is that day, when I’ve had enough of normal, when the rocking of a boat or the clapping of thunder or the blasting of the bastion of ordinary all seem like peaceful moments, when my mind can settle from its own wreckage. And then quiet.
