Dreams are fragments of our imaginations. They are products of our desires, fears, and ambitions, hidden away into our subconscious and only manifesting during sleep, when we reach into the deep pockets of our memories. So it’s practically impossible to control our dreams, like how it’s impossible to control our desires. Dreams are children of the truth and show no shame in telling it.

So when I dreamt of my desires, I knew it was going to be painful. I knew it wasn’t going to end well, even more so that I couldn’t control what my dreams showed me. I’ve always known my mind is more powerful than the body that holds it.

I dreamt of a future, one that held me and my desires in the same hand. It was a blissful dream and it was dark, like all dreams are. There were things I knew even when I did not see or hear or touch, because dreams tell you about who you are and what you want to be and who you want to be with, even without a hint of the truth. Dreams can tell you even without telling you.

But even if dreams cannot tell you about reality, because they do not know it, dreams do not lie. And I am most afraid of things that do not show you the world but neither lie about it, because the lack of their knowledge and the fullness of their wisdom all know more about you than you know about yourself.

I dreamt of my desires and the future last night, all held in the same hand. I dreamt of a conversation and a kiss.

You.

All of which, I knew, when I woke up, would never be mine.
