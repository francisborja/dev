In case of mortal catastrophe: I wish it to be known that I, Francis, resident of Planet Earth, born 23 orbital periods past, witnessed the cataclysmic events of this previous revolution around our galaxy's star, and survived.

If there are other survivors out there, please know you are not alone. Strap yourselves in to your seats and remember to keep the oxygen tank on your person at all times. Please make sure you take care of other passengers in your sector because the spinning ball ship is not obliged to stop if you are unable to attend to your own needs or administer the requirements in your area.

Itâ€™s going to be another long trip. According to the flight plan, there will be turbulence ahead, but there will also be more clear skies than in the previous voyage. May the stars guide us home.
