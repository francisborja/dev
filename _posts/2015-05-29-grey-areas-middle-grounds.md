The taxi driver was listening to the FM radio on a non-social volume. He was driving with the rhythm of the screaming man in the station booth, while I had to bear with him shouting his frustrations about the local government.

It made me think about how shallow the FM person was (I refuse to call him a news anchor, not even anchor, or any form of media deference because he was full of shitty credibility, if any). But more so, I thought about how similar we were in our plight for social justice and our innate hatred towards capitalism. He screamed his issues while I wrote mine, but we were putting as many exclamation points as possible to try to get our opinions across. I thought about how futile and ineffective the method of discussion was and how, despite all the sweaty, bloody, seemingly important ways we tried to make people listen and act, we are still here, whining about the world, and people hearing us because of our volume, but not listening to us because of the gravity of our cause.

I sometimes point to the sky and reprimand the Big Guy up there that there is something severely wrong with how the world is turning. Probably on the wrong axis and the opposite revolution or probably there is too much gravity that’s holding on to the people we need to let go of (you have my permission to make as many conclusions as you want about this hahaha). But I think about the monstrosity of our methods and the whimsicality of our ways that we try to correct the movements of the planet—away from greed and into social good, from inequality to freedom of choice, from selfishness to humanity. We are so afraid that if one day the world will have its last and fall off course, there’s no way in the universe that we can push Earth back to its axis.

Must our ends, our ideal future rationalize our means and ways? I’ve come to accept the middle grounds in our lives and that we cannot always correct by only either end of the stick. Our methods cannot always be black and white, and somewhere along the infinite spectrum of morality, we will always find ourselves on a shade of grey, however light or dark.
